Caller-saved registers are saved before calling another function
- r10, r11: Scratch registers
- rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9: Argument registers
- rax, rdx: Return values

Callee-saved registers are saved inside the function
- rbx, r12â€“r15: Saved registers

- rsp: Stack pointer
- rbp: Frame pointer (assuming -fno-omit-framepointer)
